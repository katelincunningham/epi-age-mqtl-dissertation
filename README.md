# Age and Genetic Impact on Age-associated CpGs

## Project Overview

This repository contains code and scripts used to analyse DNA methylation at the CpG site cg10501210, with a focus on its association with ageing across multiple tissues and the potential genetic regulation by the mQTL rs41317993.
The analysis integrates array-based methylation datasets and Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing data to:

Test whether cg10501210 is consistently hypomethylated with age across tissues.

Investigate age and genotype effects on cg10501210 methylation in long-read datasets.

Explore haplotype-specific methylation patterns.

The study provides insights into whether cg10501210 functions as a pan-tissue ageing biomarker and evaluates possible genetic influences in ONT long-read data.
